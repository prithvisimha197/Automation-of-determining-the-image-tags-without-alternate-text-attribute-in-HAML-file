# determine_img_tag_without_alt
I was going through a directory which contains multiple HAML files and I observed that some of the image tags contained alt attribute and some of the image tags did not contain alt attributes. So I thought of automating the process and alleviate the programmer by designing a ruby script that would display the list of image tag which does not contain the alt attribute, image tag which contains alt attribute or both image tag with and without alt attributes according to the user's choice and display such image tags along with the directory path.
